### <center>“We are, all of us, creatures of habit, and when the seeming necessity for schooling ourselves in new ways ceases to exist, we fall naturally and easily into the manner and customs which long usage has implanted ineradicably within us.” <br><br> ― Edgar Rice Burroughs, <em>The Beasts of Tarzan</em></center>


“We are all creatures of habit” -- a phrase that I have heard, I’m sure many of you have heard, and one that I often think about. I supposed there was some literary origin to this old adage and a quick google search confirmed my supposition. Feel free to Wikipedia <em>The Beasts of Tarzan</em> as I did if you want to find out more about that. It’s interesting that there is more to this quote than what we often think about when we talk about being creatures of habit. At least in my experience, I’ve heard the short phrase used as a means of excusing actions that someone does on a regular basis. It would seem, however, that the rest of the quote might serve as a caution for us to look closely at some of our own habits.

In other words: When our capacity for learning, doing and experiencing new things subsides

It is easy for us to fall back on what we know, what we have done for a long time, what is comfortable to us. As creatures of habit, a lack of learning and experiencing new things causes us to gravitate back to habits that we are used to.

After reading the full quote I feel it urgent to discuss the importance of seeking discomfort, and by that I mean that we should be careful to make sure that we don’t stop learning and trying new things that are out of our comfort zone. But that is a topic for another time. Here I want to share my thoughts on the importance of building good habits. If the quote is accurate, then there are sure to come times in our lives when experiential learning is slowed. It is during these times that having good habits to fall back on is crucial to maintaining personal growth or at the very least preventing us from losing the growth that we have already experienced.

I want to explore some good habits I have set up for myself and my reasons for doing them. I would define a “good” habit as an intentional one. “Intentional” is a word that gets thrown around a lot in (christian) circles I am in so please know that when I say intentional I mean something that serves a purpose. An Intentional habit always has a “why?” factor associated with it. I would argue that, naturally, we as humans are inclined to practice bad habits. These tend to be habits that are the easiest for us, take the least amount of effort, and while they may bring us momentary satisfaction, they often have greater long-term consequences. Since graduating college last May, I have been convicted of some bad habits and felt the need to establish some new intentional habits. I find it most helpful to incorporate intentional habits into my daily routine. Holding to a strict daily routine has helped me grow in my self-discipline and ensure that these good habits are easier for me to stick to. 

I start my weekdays waking up between 4:30 and 4:45am (No, I’m not kidding). One habit that has been so important for me to make sure I establish as a christian is spending time with God: reading the Bible, praying and listening to what he has to say to me. I have an Aeropress made by 5 o’clock and am in my chair with my Bible open. Sometime between 5:45 and 6:00 I’ll head back to the kitchen to eat breakfast and make my second cup of coffee (usually a pour over), which I’ll take to work. I’ll get dressed, and am out the door around 6:30 to catch the bus which gets me to the office a little before 7.
A couple things to note here. I love being the first one awake and one of the first ones to the office because it allows me to take my time getting my day started. I also pack my work bag, lunch and set my clothes out the night before so that I don’t have to spend mental energy on those things in the morning. This allows me to progress quickly through my morning without feeling rushed -- I HATE the feeling of being rushed. I am very thankful to be in a job with a fairly flexible start schedule. I usually choose to work from 7:00-4:00 as I find I am more productive and focused in the morning and like having the extra time at the end of the day to give to things outside of work. 

When I get home I immediately change clothes and get a workout in. For me this often looks like going on an outdoor run. I have found the best time for me to work out is right after work, after I have been sitting down in a cubicle for quite a long time and racking up things to think about. It’s kind of therapeutic to go outside and let off some steam for a couple miles (I still run outside in the winter. In fact, I love running in the snow!) After my run I’ll come back, shower, throw on some comf-clothes, and make dinner. I’ll admit I’m content using many of the same ingredients every day. My typical dinner dish consists of a lot of vegetables, eggs and occasionally some form of meat. Several days a week I might eat out with friends or over at someone’s house so limiting the ingredients that I buy makes it easier to make smarter meal decisions at home.

When I don’t have other commitments in the evening I am currently trying to spend time working on my website, reading books, and writing. These are things that I have wanted to do for a long time but never set aside the time. Whether it’s for 30 minutes or 3 hours, It feels good to go to bed feeling a sense of accomplishment completing some work on those things. And speaking of going to bed, I try to be in bed before 10pm so it’s easier for me to wake up and do it all again the next day

I don’t think there has been a day that I have executed this routine to perfection. This shouldn’t be a surprise given the million curve-balls life throws each day. To be honest I feel like if this was actually how my day went every weekday, 52 weeks a year, I would get bored really fast!  What I am trying to do by establishing this routine is to build more intentional habits. I believe that  Mr. Edgar Rice Burroughs’ observation is correct. In slower seasons of our life we are going to fall back to habits that are easiest for us. That being said, I want the habits that I fall back on to be good habits and establishing good habits takes intentionality. I challenge you to consider what one good habit you might add into your daily routine this next week.

Caveat: This might seem like a hyper-optimistic view to have around habits and routine which is probably true. Know that I am not perfect at practicing these habits every day. In fact, after posting this I’m probably going to run home, bury myself in my couch and watch a war movie. Some days are harder than others but hopefully by continuing to be intentional, the habits that are harder will become more easy and enjoyable. Many of mine already have. No one is perfect, so don’t expect building habits to go perfectly. There is a ton of freedom and grace on the journey.

Peace, love and God bless!
