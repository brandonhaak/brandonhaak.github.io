[Earlier this week I wrote](http://brandonhaak.com/thoughts/2020/02/16/start-talking-about-money) a bit about one of the least shared, most individualized topics in our culture today: money. We shy away from discussing it due to the many negative emotions and experiences we have tied to the subject. I believe it might do us some good to be more open about these emotions and experiences as they often affect our relationships with ourselves and others. 

## What Are Money Goals?

A simple way to start talking more about money is to ask a friend about their money goals. Maybe you’re someone who has never thought about setting money goals. What I mean by a “money goal” is something that you hope to one day have enough money to do. Money is the means to an end. Simply having a lot of money is not a good goal. Having money to do things like give generously, travel, or leave an inheritance to your children’s children -- these are money goals. Money goals can be a motivation to work hard and make smart decisions when spending money. If you have never dreamed about some money goals for yourself, I highly recommend taking some time to do so. Forget how much money you have now and dream big, ridiculous things you would love to be able to do with money someday.

Once you have a set of money goals, the next step is to map out what it is going to take to get there. This is the stage where I feel like so many people struggle. They start to dream big and get excited for their money goals, like helium being pumped into a balloon. But then, like a pin to that balloon, they glance back at their current situation and see all the time and work that stands between them and their money goals and they lose hope. Not seeing any progress toward our money goals contributes to the negative emotions we have surrounding money. Sharing our money goals with others, even asking their advice on how we can achieve them might take some courage but can be huge in helping us not lose focus on them.

## Budgeting

Budgeting your money is an absolute necessity when trying to achieve money goals. Similar to how [good habits have a purpose](http://brandonhaak.com/thoughts/2020/01/24/creatures-of-habit), budgeting your money is giving purpose to each dollar that comes in. Contrary to popular opinion, a budget doesn’t have to be restrictive. I remember listening to a [podcast](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/ramit-sethi-interview-rich-life/) a while ago on the topic of personal finance and saving money with author and speaker Ramit Sethi. Ramit says that everyone has one thing that they absolutely LOVE spending money on more than anything else and he asks the question: What if you took the amount that you usually spend on that thing and quadrupled (4X) it? To do this you would have to lower the amounts that you spend on other things that are less important to you but you gain the freedom to richly enjoy that one thing in a greater capacity. Creating a budget that gives each dollar a purpose gives you confidence that your needs will be taken care of and gives you freedom to spend your money.

It can be awkward but very helpful to talk about your budget with someone else. It’s important to remember that we all have different things that are important to us and how we budget our money will reflect that. Seeing someone else’s budget is an opportunity to reflect on how you budget and spend your own money.

## Getting Personal

With all of this in mind, I want to take the lead in sharing some of my own money goals, my plans to achieve them, and my current monthly budget. I am in my first year out of college and my #1 short-term money goal is to pay off my student loans and become debt-free. To me, becoming completely debt-free and not having any of my monthly income set aside for payments makes the most sense to help me achieve some of my long-term money goals (I’ll talk about those at the end).

So here it is. My current monthly budget. Let’s talk a little bit about each section. (Note: I use an app called [EveryDollar](https://www.everydollar.com/) so this may look familiar to some of you.)

![Brandons-Budget](/backgrounds/budget.png){:class="post-image-responsive"}

### Income
This amount is my average monthly post-tax income. Some months it may fluctuate but, generally, this is the amount I try and budget out. 

### Giving
I have come to learn that I am someone who loves money a lot, and I find great security in my money. As a christian I know that this is something to be careful of and so one of the ways I want to combat this is through being generous. I pray fervently for a financially generous heart and the means by which to be generous. For now I give 10% of my post-tax income as tithe to my church and an additional 2% to missionary units with whom I have connections. A money goal I have for the end of this year is to be generously giving 15% of my monthly gross income.

### Savings
If you don’t know, I am a pretty big Dave Ramsey fan. Though I do admit my plan is a little “dave-ish” as he would say. I do have a $1,000 emergency fund saved and am doing ZERO monthly saving outside of that, including investing in retirement. Ah, I can sense all the dads cringing as they read that. Boy, have I gotten into some heated discussions when I tell people I’m taking a year off of investing but before I digress, let’s move on…

### Housing
I often joke that my living situation is the most college-like that I have lived at this point in my life. I currently share a 3 bedroom apartment with 3 other guys (though we all 4 sleep in one bedroom -- ask me about that another time). My share of the rent is about $375/month which is outstanding considering I can see the Sears Tower from my house and also very helpful as I work to get my student loans paid off. The remaining money in this section goes toward internet, gas, and miscellaneous apartment supply expenses.

### Transportation
I am quite blessed to receive a pre-tax commuter benefit from my employer which I use to pay for a monthly public transportation pass. This comes out of my last paycheck of the month so it has already been factored into the income portion of the chart above. I do sometimes set aside money for gas if I’m borrowing someone’s car or, in this case, I have set aside $19 to pay for a round trip train ticket to visit my family in a couple weeks. I don’t own a car but will often share rides and Uber (that comes out of another part of the budget).

### Food
Finally some spending money! I have an item under food called “Groceries/Hangs” which is used for just that. It’s usually between $200 and $250 each month and this goes toward Aldi shopping, eating out, beer, Uber rides back home if I’m out late, and pretty much anything else that comes up as a hangout event. I try and have fun as cheaply as possible in this season of life. Remember how everyone has that thing the LOVE spending money on? Well, right now for me it’s coffee so each month I set aside $50 to buy different bags of GOOD coffee for my roommates and I to brew ourselves. It’s the little things, ya know?

### The Spread
I created this section back when I was spending more money and would separate food from entertainment/other miscellaneous expenses. Now the only thing here is my monthly Spotify payment. (which as you can see has some ridiculous Chicago tax added to it)

### Insurance and Tax
Like I said, I am only factoring post-tax income into this budget. My parents have graciously allowed me to remain on both their family insurance policy and phone plan as I am working to get out of debt so right now there is no expense for these Items. 

### Debt
And finally, the beast, the money sucker herself: debt. My dad and I worked to pay some of my way through school but I still ended up taking out 8 federally-insured student loans totalling close to $30,000. I began working to pay these off immediately upon graduation and am happy to say I am down to my last 2 loans! They are the largest but If I can keep throwing money at them the way I have been, I will be completely debt-free this June!

I dream BIG, and getting out of debt is my first step in accomplishing some of these money goals. What money goals do you dream of and how are you working to achieve them?

P.S. Hope this is helpful as you think about where you are on your own money journey. Once I am out of debt my budget will look radically different, I will be investing, and setting aside additional money to help me achieve some of these money goals.  I love talking about my budget and how I spend my money so feel free to reach out with any follow up questions you may have.

P.P.S. Hopefully this will be my last post on money for a bit. I have some other thoughts in the pipeline that I am excited to share with you all. Make sure you follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/haakeye12/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thebhaak6) to know when I post new thoughts! God bless.
