## Hello!
My name is Brandon Haak. I am a soon-to-be 23-year old, happily  living in Chicago, Illinois - one of the greatest cities in the world! I am a recent graduate of the University of Illinois at Chicago where, by God’s grace, I obtained a certificate that says I know Computer Science. (If you must know, by college I had already grown tired of the classroom). I currently live in the (quite affordable) Pilsen neighborhood with 3 roommates and I work in the (highly affluent) West Loop neighborhood as a Software Developer. So I code by day and, in my free time I’m trying to figure out how to ace post-college living. Not going to lie, not having to balance work AND a school schedule anymore is just as nice as I anticipated that it would be. I know, I know. This particular season won’t last forever so I am trying to be thankful and make the most of it.

I try to be a pretty disciplined guy. I work out and run several miles 5-6 days per week, cook often rather than eating out, and I live a fairly minimalist and frugal lifestyle. (currently trying to be debt-free by this summer!)

I am a Christian and my faith in Jesus is the cornerstone of all that I do. It shapes the way that I process what’s going on in the culture, politics, current events. My faith shapes how I make decisions, how I interact with others, and even perform daily mundane tasks.

I am a pastor’s kid, the oldest child of 4 - my parents’ test subject as I often like to joke. I grew up attending a non-denominational, evangelical church, and am currently a member of an Anglican church. My sister says I’m a “six” and my mom says I’m “melancholic” but you should know that I really hate labels.

Oh! How could I forget to mention my love for coffee! Everyone says they love coffee but they don’t. I do. I had roasted my own for a while but since moving to an apartment that has an alley for a backyard, things have become more complicated. I rely on my coffee subscription service and a plethora rosters around the city to keep me stocked. I have a fascination with fermented things and am currently growing my own sourdough levain in my kitchen (he/she is about 5-days old and still needs a name). My other interests include playing and watching sports, listening to music (Spotify) and podcasts, Star Wars, cold weather, being outdoors, keeping up with tech trends, wrestling with theology, and just thinking about life.

## What Is This About?
For a long time I have toyed with the idea of writing but I struggled to think of what I should write about. Should I start a blog? Maybe one of those really “christianese” blogs that’s feel-good and has a lot of big words? How often would I have to write? Would people even read my writing? These questions and fears have been swirling around in my head for some time and have thus caused writing to ride the back-burner in my life. 

In recent weeks the thought has recurred in my mind that I need to just start. As a recovering perfectionist the thought of putting a sub-polished piece of work out to the world seems preposterous. I have read authors and I follow content creators who talk about one of the hardest parts being the initial start. In order to succeed in writing (or any other thing for that matter) you need to set start by setting goals and worry only about hitting the next goal.

What I really want for my life is to become a better communicator. Both in speaking and written communication. One of the ways I figured to do this would be to just write about what’s on my mind. Not trying to force anything. Not trying and write what other people want to hear or support one side of something or the other but to write simply my thoughts. I like to think I am a fairly reserved person. I am certainly non-confrontational - I avoid conflict like the plague (yes, I see how this is a problem, I’m not saying it isn’t, I’m working through it). This being the case I rarely share my thoughts on something unless invited to do so and even then my thoughts may be brief as my full, comprehensive analysis may not be appropriate or helpful to share. Silence does not mean that I have not come to my own convictions on topics of discussion. There is a time and a place to discuss everything.

All of this to say welcome to my thoughts. And that’s just what they are - mine. I’m not asking that you agree with them but I hope that they cause some to stop and consider their own thoughts. I am also curious to see if others share my thoughts. I honestly believe that in this bipartisan world we live in more and more people, particularly young people,  are feeling like me: that they don’t fit in to either one side.  I plan to write about what I want to write about. Not all thoughts I publish on here will be weighty topics. Some of my thoughts may be me arguing about why Starbucks is trash or talking about a dope piece of tech I came across on Twitter. 

All these thoughts are my own unless otherwise stated. I hope that you find some of them helpful to consider as you do your own thinking and at the very least I hope you derive some joy from reading these things. I have made a goal to post 2-3 thoughts per month during 2020 and am excited for some of the ideas already in the pipeline to discuss. Thank you all for reading! Sorry I am still developing this site and do not yet have a way for you to subscribe to my content so keep an eye on Twitter and Instagram for my next thought bubble coming your way. God bless!
