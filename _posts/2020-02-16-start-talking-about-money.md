Money is on the short list of things that we are taught never to bring up in polite conversation. Other topics on the list include politics, religion, and sex. This has been the etiquette most of us are taught growing up, though in recent years the culture seems to have shifted to a more open discussion of politics, religion and sex. It seems we are now living in a day where an individual’s political views, religious affiliations and sex life are encouraged to be shared and celebrated. Money on the other hand remains this sort of hush-hush, don’t ask don’t tell topic where I make however much I make and spend it on whatever I want and you do the same and we all just mind our own business. I, too, am a product of this social construct.

## What is the reason for this? 

I came across [an article in the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/smarter-living/the-benefits-of-sharing-your-salary.html) a little while back referencing this phenomenon. In it author Tim Herrera cites an interview he had with money expert Brianna McGurran who explains 

### <center> “Money is so tied up with really complex and difficult emotions, like shame, success, fear of failure, and how people view you...”  </center>

Have you ever experienced any of these emotions surrounding money? I certainly have. I have the tendency to find security in money -- the bigger the pile of cash in my checking and savings accounts, the more comfortable and secure I feel. I am afraid at the end of the month when all the bills have gone out and the number remaining in my account is significantly lower than I’d like it to be. I sometimes feel guilty after making a purchase, worrying that the money I spent might have been better spent elsewhere. I feel a sense of relief every time a paycheck comes through and I see the account balance bounce back up. Dang, money really does have a significant effect on my emotions! 

## Stereotypes

How might we expect our money to affect how others view us? I think it’s safe to say most of us would like more of it than we currently have. Think about your perception of someone who you believe to have more money than you. Whether we admit it or not, some natural feelings usually surface: jealousy, envy, bitterness. None of these are good feelings to have. Sometimes these feelings even lead us to scoff at or demonize someone with more money than us. We live in a system where having more money allows for more opportunity, options and freedoms and when we see others exercising those options and freedoms, we feel like we’ve been short-changed (Ha!). The truth is how we view others is how we subconsciously expect others to view us and so we try and bury our own money situation to avoid being judged as we often judge others.

## The Biggest Problem

Another observation by our money expert from the interview referenced above:  

### <center>“...when you’re talking about how much you earn, or how much you’re saving, a lot of people end up tying that to their self-worth”</center> 

Ummm, Guilty! I have definitely conflated these two things before. How tragic is it that we reduce our value as created human beings to the number in our bank accounts. Please hear me when I say this: **Your net-worth does not equal your self-worth.** You have been created with a greater purpose than to just make as much money as possible. You have been given unique passions and abilities to create, sustain, heal, teach, and so much more. A reason we do not discuss money is we believe the lie that our financial situation renders us insignificant and unqualified to talk about it. We are embarrassed.

## Let’s Start Talking about Money

As I said before, money has a significant impact on our emotions. Consequently, the emotions we have surrounding money begin to impact our own physical and mental health, as well as our interactions with others. With that in mind, why don’t we do ourselves a favor and start being more open about money with others. My church recently did a Bible study on generosity and, naturally, money was a topic of conversation. Some of us were challenged to share our monthly budgets with our small group as a step to begin a healthy money conversation. On top of removing some of the stereotypical feelings mentioned above and giving me a deeper feeling of respect for those who shared, this activity helped us all to reflect on our own spending habits. We were able to practically talk about how we as christians should be prioritizing our spending. I’m not suggesting that you need to go and share every financial detail of your life with everyone you know. Consider some of the unhealthy ways money causes you to think, act, and interact with others. Seek out a few close people and ask if they would be willing to have a conversation about money with you.

## To Be Continued...

Later this week I plan to post a follow-up detailing and discussing my own money including my monthly budget, what I spend, and why. My assumption is that many of you reading this are, like me, still trying to figure this whole money thing out. Don’t let the negative feelings surrounding money prevent you from receiving helpful insight into managing your own. We are all at different places in our money journey so let’s encourage each other along the way.

Good vibes only!
