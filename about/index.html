            Hi! My name is Brandon, welcome to my website. It’s not an impressive website from a full-stack web developer’s perspective but hopefully it fulfills its current purpose and I look forward to continuing to make improvements to it. The current purpose of this site is to provide a place for me to store and share some of my thoughts. Go on and take a look at my first thought from 1-10-2020 to get an idea of what those might look like. Aside from those I am still looking into different things I could add to give this site some value. If you have any ideas for me, feel free to send me a suggestion or contact me on the social medias. Thanks for visiting, I hope your time here is well-spent.
